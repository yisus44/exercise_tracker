# exercise_tracker
Exercise tracker with nodejs, mongodb, helmet and express 

Demo here! https://flores-exercise-tracker.herokuapp.com/

I choose mongodb because its easy to get a cluster up and running thanks to atlas but any other db could work. It also fit well into Heroku.
Helmet middleware is used to provide fast and reliable security to a express application, might add other modules such as rate-limiter-flexible to improve security against ddos 
Express is lightweight and very known, nevertheless hapi was also considered. Might try to replicate this project with Fastify to learn about that framework.

If you found this repository for some reason and want to replicate for get some practice with node, this diagrams might help you if you are stuck:
